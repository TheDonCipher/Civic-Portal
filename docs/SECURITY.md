### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### User Roles

```typescript
enum UserRole {
  CITIZEN = 'citizen',

  ADMIN = 'admin',
}
```

#### Permission Matrix

| Feature              | Citizen | Official | Admin |
| -------------------- | ------- | -------- | ----- |
| Create Issues        | ✓       | ✓        | ✓     |
| Comment on Issues    | ✓       | ✓        | ✓     |
| Vote on Issues       | ✓       | ✓        | ✓     |
| Update Issue Status  | ✗       | ✓        | ✓     |
| Add Official Updates | ✗       | ✓        | ✓     |
| Manage Users         | ✗       | ✗        | ✓     |
| Verify Officials     | ✗       | ✗        | ✓     |
| Access Admin Panel   | ✗       | ✗        | ✓     |

#### Verification Workflow

1. **Official Registration**: Self-registration with department selection
2. **Pending Status**: Account created with limited access
3. **Admin Review**: Manual verification by administrators
4. **Document Verification**: Validate government credentials
5. **Approval/Rejection**: Grant or deny official status

const rateLimits = {
  authentication: '5 requests per minute',
  issueCreation: '10 requests per hour',
  commenting: '30 requests per hour',
  voting: '100 requests per hour',
};
```

  title: z.string().min(5).max(200),
  description: z.string().min(20).max(5000),
  category: z.enum(['infrastructure', 'health', 'education']),
  location: z.string().optional(),
});
```

  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE id = auth.uid()
      AND role = 'official'
      AND department_id = issues.department_id
    )
  );
```
