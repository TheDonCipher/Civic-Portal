# Official Verification Workflow Testing Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to test the complete official verification workflow in the Civic Portal.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure the application is running locally or deployed
2. Have access to an admin account
3. Have access to test email accounts for creating official accounts

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete Verification Workflow (Happy Path)

#### Step 1: Register as Government Official
1. Navigate to the registration page
2. Select "Government Official" as account type
3. Fill in the form with test data:
   - Full Name: "Test Official"
   - Email: "testofficial@example.com"
   - Username: "testofficial"
   - Department: Select any department (e.g., "Health")
   - Password: Create a secure password
4. Accept terms and complete registration
5. Verify email if email verification is enabled

**Expected Result**: 
- User account created with `role: 'official'` and `verification_status: 'pending'`
- User receives welcome email
- User cannot access stakeholder dashboard yet

#### Step 2: Attempt to Access Stakeholder Dashboard (Before Verification)
1. Log in as the test official
2. Navigate to `/stakeholder` or try to access stakeholder features

**Expected Result**:
- User sees "Account Verification Pending" message
- Clear explanation of the verification process
- Options to "Contact Support" and "Return to Home"
- No access to stakeholder dashboard features

#### Step 3: Admin Verification Process
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to the Admin Panel (`/admin`)
3. Go to the "Users" tab
4. Find the test official in the list
5. Verify the user shows `verification_status: 'pending'`
6. Click the green checkmark (âœ“) button to verify the user
7. Confirm the verification in the dialog

**Expected Result**:
- User's `verification_status` changes to `'verified'`
- Admin sees success message
- Notification is sent to the official
- Real-time update reflects the change immediately

#### Step 4: Official Receives Notification
1. As the test official, check the notification bell in the header
2. Click on the notification bell

**Expected Result**:
- Notification badge shows unread count
- Notification appears with title "Account Verified! ðŸŽ‰"
- Message explains verification success and dashboard access
- Clicking notification marks it as read

#### Step 5: Access Stakeholder Dashboard (After Verification)
1. As the verified official, navigate to `/stakeholder`
2. Explore the dashboard features

**Expected Result**:
- Full access to stakeholder dashboard
- Department-specific issue filtering
- Ability to manage issues within assigned department
- All stakeholder features available

### Scenario 2: Verification Rejection Workflow

#### Step 1: Register Another Official
1. Create another test official account following Step 1 above
2. Use different email: "testofficial2@example.com"

#### Step 2: Admin Rejects Verification
1. As admin, find the new official in the admin panel
2. Click the red X (âœ—) button to reject verification
3. Provide a rejection reason: "Invalid credentials provided"
4. Confirm the rejection

**Expected Result**:
- User's `verification_status` changes to `'rejected'`
- `verification_notes` field stores the rejection reason
- Notification sent to the official

#### Step 3: Official Sees Rejection
1. Log in as the rejected official
2. Try to access stakeholder dashboard
3. Check notifications

**Expected Result**:
- "Account Verification Rejected" message displayed
- Rejection reason shown in the message
- Notification explains the rejection
- Contact support option available

### Scenario 3: Notification System Testing

#### Step 1: Test Notification Reading
1. As any user with notifications, click the notification bell
2. Click on individual notifications
3. Use "Mark all read" button

**Expected Result**:
- Individual notifications marked as read when clicked
- "Mark all read" clears all unread notifications
- Notification badge updates correctly
- Database reflects read status changes

#### Step 2: Test Real-time Updates
1. Have admin and official accounts open in different browsers
2. Admin verifies/rejects an official
3. Check if official sees real-time updates

**Expected Result**:
- Changes appear immediately without page refresh
- Notifications appear in real-time
- Dashboard access updates immediately

### Scenario 4: Edge Cases and Error Handling

#### Step 1: Test Invalid State Transitions
1. Try to verify an already verified user
2. Try to reject an already rejected user

**Expected Result**:
- Appropriate error messages
- No duplicate notifications
- System handles gracefully

#### Step 2: Test Permission Boundaries
1. Try to access admin panel as non-admin
2. Try to access stakeholder dashboard as citizen
3. Try to verify users without admin privileges

**Expected Result**:
- Proper access control enforced
- Clear error messages
- Redirects to appropriate pages

## Database Verification

After each test, verify the database state:

### Check Profiles Table
```sql
SELECT id, username, role, verification_status, verification_notes, department_id 
FROM profiles 
WHERE role = 'official';
```

### Check Notifications Table
```sql
SELECT user_id, type, title, message, read, created_at 
FROM notifications 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Check Audit Logs
```sql
SELECT action, resource_type, user_id, details, created_at 
FROM audit_logs 
WHERE action IN ('verification_update', 'role_update')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Performance Testing

1. **Load Testing**: Create multiple official accounts and verify them simultaneously
2. **Real-time Testing**: Test with multiple users online to ensure real-time updates work
3. **Notification Scaling**: Test with many notifications to ensure performance

## Security Testing

1. **Authorization**: Ensure only admins can verify users
2. **Data Integrity**: Verify that verification status changes are properly logged
3. **Input Validation**: Test with invalid data in verification forms

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Notifications not appearing
- Check if notifications table exists and has proper RLS policies
- Verify notification creation in database
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Real-time updates not working
- Verify Supabase real-time is enabled
- Check subscription setup in components
- Ensure proper channel names and event types

### Issue: Access control not working
- Verify profile data is loaded correctly
- Check role and verification_status values
- Ensure proper authentication state

### Issue: Database errors
- Check if all migrations have been applied
- Verify table schemas match expected structure
- Check for missing columns or constraints

## Success Criteria

The verification workflow is considered successful when:

1. âœ… Officials can register and receive pending status
2. âœ… Unverified officials cannot access stakeholder features
3. âœ… Admins can verify/reject officials with proper feedback
4. âœ… Notifications are sent and received correctly
5. âœ… Verified officials gain full stakeholder access
6. âœ… Rejected officials see appropriate messages
7. âœ… Real-time updates work across all components
8. âœ… All database changes are properly logged
9. âœ… Error handling works for edge cases
10. âœ… Performance is acceptable under normal load
