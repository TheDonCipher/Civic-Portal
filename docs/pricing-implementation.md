## Design Philosophy

### 1. Community-Centric Approach

The pricing model reflects the Ubuntu philosophy where individual contributions strengthen the collective. This is evident in:

- Micro-contribution model starting at BWP 5

### 2. Cultural Sensitivity

- Integration of Setswana language and concepts
