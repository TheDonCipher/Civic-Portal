# Enhanced Notification Security System Documentation

## Overview

The enhanced notification system implements comprehensive security measures to ensure proper filtering, delivery, and access control for notifications in the Civic Portal. This system prevents notification spam, ensures user privacy, and maintains data integrity through multiple layers of security.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Database-Level Security

#### **Row Level Security (RLS) Policies**
- **User-Specific Access**: Users can only view and update their own notifications
- **Admin Override**: Administrators can view all notifications for dashboard purposes
- **Insertion Control**: Only authenticated users can create notifications through system functions
- **Expiration Filtering**: Expired notifications are automatically filtered from queries

#### **Enhanced Database Functions**
- `should_notify_user()`: Determines if a user should receive a notification based on their relationship to the content
- `prevent_duplicate_notification()`: Prevents duplicate notifications within a time window
- `create_secure_notification()`: Creates notifications with comprehensive security checks
- `cleanup_expired_notifications()`: Removes expired notifications from the system

### 2. User-Specific Filtering

#### **Role-Based Filtering**
Users receive notifications based on their role and permissions:

- **Citizens**: Receive notifications for issues they created, watch, or engage with
- **Government Officials**: Receive department-specific notifications plus citizen-level notifications
- **Administrators**: Receive system-wide notifications plus role-specific notifications

#### **Relationship-Based Filtering**
Notifications are filtered based on user relationships to content:

- **Issue Authors**: Receive notifications for their own issues
- **Issue Watchers**: Receive notifications for issues they're watching
- **Commenters**: Receive notifications for issues they've commented on
- **Solution Proposers**: Receive notifications for issues they've proposed solutions for
- **Department Officials**: Receive notifications for issues in their department

### 3. Action-Based Notification Rules

#### **Legitimate Action Triggers**
Notifications are only created for legitimate user actions:

```sql
-- Issue creation → Notify department officials
-- Issue status change → Notify watchers, author, commenters, department officials
-- New comment → Notify watchers, author, other commenters
-- New solution → Notify watchers, author, other solution proposers
-- Account verification → Notify specific user only
-- Role changes → Notify specific user only
```

#### **Self-Notification Prevention**
Users never receive notifications for their own actions:
- Comment authors don't get notified of their own comments
- Issue creators don't get notified when they update their own issues
- Solution proposers don't get notified of their own solutions

### 4. Issue Update Notification Filtering

#### **Watcher-Based System**
The system uses an `issue_watchers` table to track user interest:

```sql
-- Auto-watch rules:
-- ✓ Users automatically watch issues they create
-- ✓ Users automatically watch issues they comment on
-- ✓ Users automatically watch issues they propose solutions for
-- ✓ Department officials automatically watch issues in their department
```

#### **Notification Recipients**
For issue-related notifications, users receive notifications if they are:
1. **Issue Author** - Created the issue
2. **Issue Watcher** - Explicitly watching the issue
3. **Commenter** - Have commented on the issue
4. **Solution Proposer** - Have proposed solutions for the issue
5. **Department Official** - Work in the department assigned to the issue

### 5. Spam Prevention Measures

#### **Duplicate Prevention**
- **Time Window**: Prevents duplicate notifications within 5-minute windows
- **Content Matching**: Compares notification type, related IDs, and content
- **Database-Level**: Implemented at the database level for reliability

#### **Rate Limiting**
- **User-Specific**: Prevents excessive notifications to individual users
- **Action-Based**: Limits notifications per action type
- **Time-Based**: Implements cooling-off periods for frequent actions

#### **Expiration Handling**
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired notifications are automatically removed
- **Creation Prevention**: Expired notifications are not created
- **Query Filtering**: Expired notifications are filtered from all queries

### 6. Database Integrity

#### **Referential Integrity**
- **User Validation**: All notifications reference valid users
- **Content Validation**: Related IDs reference existing content
- **Department Validation**: Department-based filtering uses valid department IDs

#### **Data Consistency**
- **Atomic Operations**: Notification creation is atomic and transactional
- **Trigger-Based**: Notifications are created automatically via database triggers
- **Audit Trail**: All notification actions are logged for security auditing

### 7. Real-Time Subscription Security

#### **Supabase Real-Time Filtering**
```typescript
// Server-side filtering
filter: `user_id=eq.${user.id}`

// Client-side validation
if (payload.new.user_id !== user.id) {
  console.warn('Received notification for different user, ignoring');
  return;
}
```

#### **Additional Client-Side Security**
- **User ID Validation**: Double-check user IDs on the client
- **Expiration Checking**: Validate notification expiration on the client
- **Duplicate Detection**: Client-side duplicate detection as backup
- **Content Validation**: Validate notification content structure

### 8. Security Testing

#### **Automated Test Suite**
The `notification_security_test.sql` script tests:
- User-specific filtering
- Action-based notification rules
- Issue watcher filtering
- Department-based filtering
- Duplicate prevention
- Self-notification prevention
- Expiration handling
- RLS policy enforcement

#### **Manual Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Users only see their own notifications
- [ ] Real-time notifications work correctly
- [ ] No cross-user notification leakage
- [ ] Department filtering works for officials
- [ ] Duplicate notifications are prevented
- [ ] Expired notifications are cleaned up
- [ ] Self-notifications are blocked

### 9. Implementation Guide

#### **Step 1: Apply Security Enhancements**
```sql
-- Run the enhanced security system
\i enhanced_notification_security_system.sql
```

#### **Step 2: Test Security Measures**
```sql
-- Run comprehensive security tests
\i notification_security_test.sql
```

#### **Step 3: Verify Frontend Integration**
- Enhanced NotificationBell component includes client-side security
- Real-time subscriptions are properly filtered
- User interface respects security boundaries

#### **Step 4: Monitor and Maintain**
- Regular security audits
- Performance monitoring
- User feedback collection
- Continuous improvement

### 10. Security Best Practices

#### **Database Security**
- Always use RLS policies for user data
- Implement server-side validation
- Use SECURITY DEFINER functions carefully
- Regular security audits and testing

#### **Real-Time Security**
- Filter subscriptions at the database level
- Validate data on the client side
- Use secure WebSocket connections
- Monitor for unusual subscription patterns

#### **Application Security**
- Validate user permissions before actions
