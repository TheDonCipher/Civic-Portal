# Civic Portal Database Schema Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive audit of the Civic Portal database schema reveals a well-structured foundation with several critical gaps that need immediate attention. The database supports most core features but has significant missing components that prevent full functionality of the voting system, engagement metrics, and some advanced features.

## 🔴 Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Missing Database Functions (CRITICAL)**

The following RPC functions are referenced throughout the codebase but **DO NOT EXIST** in the database:

- `increment_issue_votes(issue_id: string)`
- `decrement_issue_votes(issue_id: string)`
- `increment_issue_watchers(issue_id: string)`
- `decrement_issue_watchers(issue_id: string)`
- `increment_solution_votes(solution_id: string)`
- `decrement_solution_votes(solution_id: string)`

**Impact**: All voting and watching functionality will fail with database errors.

### 2. **Missing Vote Count Columns (CRITICAL)**

The `issues` table lacks essential engagement metric columns:

- `vote_count` (referenced in code but missing from table)
- `watchers_count` (referenced in code but missing from table)

**Impact**: Vote counts and watcher counts cannot be stored or displayed.

### 3. **Inconsistent Voting Table Structure**

Two different voting table structures exist:

- `issue_votes` table (with `vote_type` column)
- `votes` table (generic voting table)

**Impact**: Code expects simple voting without vote_type, but tables require it.

## 🟡 Schema Gaps and Inconsistencies

### 4. **Missing Legal Consent Fields in Profiles**

The `profiles` table lacks required legal consent timestamp fields:

- `terms_accepted_at`
- `privacy_accepted_at`

**Impact**: Legal compliance workflow cannot store consent timestamps directly in profiles.

### 5. **Missing Enhanced Issue Fields**

Several fields referenced in the comprehensive schema are missing:

- `first_response_at` (for response time tracking)
- `resolved_by` (for tracking who resolved issues)
- `thumbnails` (for multiple image support)

### 6. **Missing Performance Indexes**

Critical indexes for performance are missing:

- `idx_issues_status`
- `idx_issues_category`
- `idx_issues_author_id`
- `idx_comments_issue_id`
- `idx_solutions_issue_id`

## ✅ Well-Implemented Features

### 1. **Core Table Structure**

- ✅ `departments` - Complete with all 18 Botswana departments
- ✅ `profiles` - Proper user management with roles and verification
- ✅ `issues` - Basic issue tracking with status management
- ✅ `comments` - Comment system with author tracking
- ✅ `solutions` - Solution proposals with voting support
- ✅ `notifications` - Notification system infrastructure

### 2. **Authentication & Security**

- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
- ✅ Legal consent tracking table (`legal_consents`)
- ✅ Audit logging infrastructure
- ✅ Rate limiting tables
- ✅ Security logging tables

### 3. **Role-Based Access Control**

- ✅ Proper role definitions (citizen, official, admin)
- ✅ Department-based filtering for officials
- ✅ Verification status workflow
- ✅ RLS policies for role-based access
